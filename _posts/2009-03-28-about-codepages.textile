h1. {{ page.title }}

TheSmilingPenguin::CodePages contains all coding work by me, "Martin HÃ¤ger":http://thesmilingpenguin.com/private/68607899/TQkhL0yDLidf8sd1pldggc5m. Instead of posting them on "the blog":http://thesmilingpenguin.com, coding projects will end up here.

*The technical:* TheSmilingPenguin::CodePages is hosted on "GitHub":http://github.com and all content is versioned with "Git":http://git.or.cz. In the post-commit hook, a bunch of static web pages are generated by "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll. The site pulls in Git repository data from the GitHub JSON API.
